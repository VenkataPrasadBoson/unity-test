# Unity VR Developer Test

This repository contains a test for hiring a VR Unity developer. It includes multiple-choice questions, a practical exercise, and a code analysis section. The test aims to assess the candidate's knowledge and skills in VR development using Unity.

## Test Instructions

Please read the questions carefully and select the correct answer for each multiple-choice question. For the practical exercise, implement a simple VR application in Unity based on the given requirements. Finally, analyze the provided code snippet and identify any errors or improvements.

## Test Questions

1. Which programming language is commonly used for Unity development?
   - a) C++
   - b) C#
   - c) Java
   - d) Python

2. Which component is used to handle user input in Unity?
   - a) Collider
   - b) Rigidbody
   - c) Audio Source
   - d) Input Manager

3. Which Unity feature is used to create interactive 3D environments?
   - a) Terrain
   - b) Lighting
   - c) Particle Systems
   - d) Physics

4. Which scripting API is used to move a game object in Unity?
   - a) Transform
   - b) Renderer
   - c) AudioListener
   - d) Animator

5. How can you simulate physics interactions in a VR environment using Unity?
   - a) Use the Vuforia library
   - b) Implement raycasting
   - c) Attach a virtual collider to the VR controller
   - d) Enable the VR headset tracking system

## Practical Exercise

Implement a simple VR application using Unity that meets the following requirements:

- The application should display a virtual room with walls, a floor, and a ceiling.
- The user should be able to move freely within the room using a VR headset and VR controllers.
- The user should be able to pick up and interact with virtual objects within the room using the VR controllers.
- Add at least one interactive element in the room (e.g., a button, a lever, or a switch) that triggers an action when interacted with.

## Code Analysis

Given the following code snippet written in C#, analyze the code and identify any syntax errors, logical errors, or potential improvements.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class VRInteractions : MonoBehaviour
{
    private bool isInteracting;

    private void Update()
    {
        if (isInteracting)
        {
            Debug.Log("Interacting with object.");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log("Not interacting.");
        }
    }

    public void Interact()
    {
        isInteracting = !isInteracting;
    }
}
